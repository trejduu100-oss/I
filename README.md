Create a web portal application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should have a single 'Home' page.

The 'Home' page should display a full-screen, responsive layout with a centered card. The card should have a title 'Game Portal' and a description 'Select your destination'. Inside the card, there should be a vertical list of clickable buttons, each representing a link. Each button should have a name, a description, and an associated icon. Implement a fade-in and slide-in animation for each button with staggered delays. The background of the 'Home' page should feature subtle, animated, blurred shape decorations.

The specific links (buttons) on the 'Home' page are:

Name: 'Games', Description: 'Netlify', URL: 'https://gamecry.netlify.app/'
Name: 'Games by ExploitZ3r0', Description: 'Render', URL: 'https://games-by-exploitz3r01.onrender.com/'
Name: 'Games ExploitZ3r0', Description: 'Vercel', URL: 'https://games-exploitz3r0.vercel.app/'
Name: 'QR Code Generator', Description: 'Created.app', URL: 'https://cry11.created.app/'
Name: 'V111', Description: 'Neocities', URL: 'https://v111.neocities.org/'
Name: 'URL GPT', Description: 'Lovable.app', URL: 'https://urlgpt.lovable.app'
Name: 'URL GPT', Description: 'Created.app', URL: 'https://urlgpt.created.app'
Ensure the entire application is responsive and maintains a clean, modern aesthetic.
